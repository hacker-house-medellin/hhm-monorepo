# Cross-repository integration tests

Place pinned compatibility tests here. Do not duplicate application or package source.

Each fixture must identify its source repository and exact revision. Reusable dependencies should resolve through canonical `hacker-house-medellin/hhm-*` Zed coordinates; retained Git submodules must have an explicit composition role and must not duplicate a Zed dependency in the same workspace.

Use root package manifests so `zed overtake --git-submodules` can adopt reviewed gitlinks while preserving `.gitmodules`, exact commits, and provenance.
