# Cross-repository integration tests

Place pinned compatibility tests here. Do not duplicate application or package source.

Each fixture must identify its source repository and exact revision. Reusable dependencies should resolve through canonical `hacker-house-medellin/hhm-*` Zed coordinates; retained Git submodules must have an explicit composition role and must not duplicate a Zed dependency in the same workspace.

`zed overtake --git-submodules` imports each initialized submodule that declares its own `.zpkg.toml` into the root manifest and lockfile while retaining `.gitmodules` as a reversible transport mirror and recording exact gitlink commits and provenance.
